* Built a region build status notifier that reduces the readiness check to check dependency status from 24 hours to less than 10 minutes allowing Key Management Service (KMS) employees to hit region build dates faster.
*	Used the Java Spring framework to initialize a worker object with restricted IAM permissions which accesses notifier webhook keys in KMS Secretes Manager, queries the DynamoDB Table, and utilizes created proxy to send notifications and update the dashboard on the availability/delay of a critical dependency.

* Created a Hilbert Space-Filling Curve Algorithm to condense n-dimensional data into a one-dimensional vector used to scan file binaries for suspicious behavior.
*	Data displayed on a dynamic website coded with React JS front-end and Flask Python back-end.
*	Implemented a Machine learning model that predicts app rating based on ManTech app metadata.
*	Used D3.js and JS to create an online heatmap of all data.

## üíº Website and App Development

### ‚ôüÔ∏è Chess Tracker [(Website Demo)](https://tarunravi.com/chessTracker/#/)
 As an avid chess player, I wanted to create a website/app to track the game statistics of each of my opponents. I use **React** for the front-end of the website, then **Firebase** for the backend. It uses **Google user authentication** and **private user generated data**. [Link to source code](https://github.com/tarunravi/chessTracker)

### üìö ManTech Hilbert Curve Visualization [(Website Demo)](https://tarunravi.com/hilbertCurve/)
The Hilbert curve is an **advanced machine learning algorithm** that can condense an n-dimensional set of data into a simple 1 dimensional vector. To learn more about the math behind the hilbert curve, I created an Hilbert Curve Visualization using HTML and JavaScript. Source code fully coded by Tarun Ravikumar, now proprietary to ManTech.

### ‚ùé Tic-Tac-Toe AI [(Website Demo)](https://tarunravi.com/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI/)
[Video Demo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHON6-JC-Xs) I designed an AI to learn how to play the popular game Tic Tac Toe without any humans teaching it using **Q-Learning**. [Link to source code](https://github.com/tarunravi/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI)

### ü§ñ ManTech Machine Learning [(Website Demo)](https://tarunravi.com/ManTechPredictingAppRating/)
Created a **Machine Learning model** that predicts app rating based on ManTech app metadata. 

Then used **D3.js** to create an interactive heatmap on the app metadata. Source code fully coded by Tarun Ravikumar, now proprietary to ManTech.

### üÉè BlackJack AI [(Video Demo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSLcoP5vAMM)
I designed an AI to learn how to play the popular game Tic Tac Toe without any humans teaching it using the **Monte-Carlo Algorithm.** [Link to source code](https://github.com/MyWorldRules/BlackjackAI)

### ‚ö° Generate Electricity By Walking! [(Video Demo)](https://youtu.be/c4PtBs9bxEM)

I created a shoe that captures the mechanical energy produced from each step and converts it into useable electricity. [Link to source code](https://tarunravi.com/GenerateElectricityByWalking/)

### üë®‚Äçüíª ManTech Scanner Application
I Created an Application that interfaces with existing ManTech technology, and enables employees to scan in equipment and track the location and scan date of every existing equipment. I used **Python and PyGame** to develop this application.  Source code fully coded by Tarun Ravikumar, now proprietary to ManTech.

### ‚ö° Robot that attends my Online Classes [(Video Demo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ9PRr0rcuQ)
 After getting permission from my teachers, for the last week of school I created a bot using **Python and Selenium** (Web Scraping framework) to automatically open my classes based on the date/time. In addition the bot listens to what my teacher says, and can respond if the teacher calls my name.

### ‚úå Robot vs Finger on the App 2 Challenge [(Video Demo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VJTTI9BsIM)
I created a robot to automate Finger on the App 2, a popular phone game. I used my computer to control my phone, then I used **Python and Pyautogui** to move the cursor to play the game. 

### üòÇ Annoying People With Pi [(Video Demo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEBqrb-T1bs)
For Pi Day 2021, I created a robot that texts the digits of Pi to all my friends, one digit at a time. I used **Python and Pyautogui** to control the keyboard, then instead of pre-computing the digits of Pi, I wrote out the power series expansion function to calculate the digits live.
