## 💼 ManTech Internship Public Projets

### [📚 ManTech Hilbert Curve Visualization](https://tarunravi.tech/hilbertCurve/
[Website Demo](https://tarunravi.tech/hilbertCurve/ The Hilbert curve is an advanced machine learning algorithm that can condense an n-dimensional set of data into a simple 1 dimensional vector. To learn more about the math behind the hilbert curve I created an Hilbert Curve Visualization using HTML and JavaScript. Source code fully coded by Tarun Ravikumar, now proprietary to ManTech.

### 👨‍💻 ManTech Scanner Application
I Created an Application that interfaces with existing ManTech technology, and enables employees to scan in equipment and track the location and scan date of every existing equipment. Source code fully coded by Tarun Ravikumar, now proprietary to ManTech.

### 🤖 ManTech Machine Learning [(View Visualization)](https://tarunravi.tech/ManTechPredictingAppRating/)
[Website Demo](https://tarunravi.tech/ManTechPredictingAppRating/) Created a Machine Learning model that predicts app rating based on ManTech app metadata. 

Then used D3.js to create an interactive heatmap on the app metadata. Source code fully coded by Tarun Ravikumar, now proprietary to ManTech.

## Personal Projects
### [♟️ Chess Tracker](https://tarunravi.tech/chessTracker/#/)
[Website Demo](https://tarunravi.tech/chessTracker/#/). As an avid chess player, I wanted to create a website/app to track the game statistics of each of my opponents. I use React for the front-end of the website, then Firebase for the backend. It uses Google user authentication and private user generated data.

### [⚡ Generate Electricity By Walking](/GenerateElectricityByWalking)

I created a shoe that captures the mechanical energy produced from each step and converts it into useable electricity. [Link to source code]https://github.com/tarunravi/GenerateElectricityByWalking

### [❎ Tic-Tac-Toe AI](https://tarunravi.tech/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI/)
[Website Demo.](https://tarunravi.tech/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI/) [Video Demo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHON6-JC-Xs) I designed an AI to learn how to play the popular game Tic Tac Toe without any humans teaching it using Q-Learning. [Link to source code]https://github.com/tarunravi/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI

### [🃏 BlackJack AI](https://github.com/MyWorldRules/BlackjackAI)
[Video Demo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSLcoP5vAMM) I designed an AI to learn how to play the popular game Tic Tac Toe without any humans teaching it using the Monte-Carlo Algorithm. [Link to source code]https://github.com/MyWorldRules/BlackjackAI

## Silly/Fun Projects
### [⚡ Robot that attends my Online Classes ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ9PRr0rcuQ)
[Video Demo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ9PRr0rcuQ) After getting permission from my teachers, for the last week of school I created a bot using Python and Selenium (Web Scraping framework) to automatically open my classes based on the date/time. In addition the bot listens to what my teacher says, and can respond if the teacher calls my name.

### [Robot vs Finger on the App 2 Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VJTTI9BsIM)
[Video Demo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VJTTI9BsIM) I created a robot to automate Finger on the App 2, a popular phone game. I used my computer to control my phone, then I used Python and Pyautogui to move the cursor to play the game. 

### [Annoying People With Pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEBqrb-T1bs)
[Video Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEBqrb-T1bs). For Pi Day 2021, I created a robot that texts the digits of Pi to all my friends, one digit at a time. I used Python and Pyautogui to control the keyboard, then instead of pre-computing the digits of Pi, I wrote out the power series expansion function to calculate the digits live.
