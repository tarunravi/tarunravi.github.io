### 📚 ManTech Hilbert Curve Visualization [(View Visualization)](https://tarunravi.tech/hilbertCurve/)
The Hilbert curve is an **advanced machine learning algorithm** that can condense an n-dimensional set of data into a simple 1 dimensional vector. To learn more about the math behind the hilbert curve, I created an Hilbert Curve Visualization using HTML and JavaScript. Source code fully coded by Tarun Ravikumar, now proprietary to ManTech.

### 👨‍💻 ManTech Scanner Application
I Created an Application that interfaces with existing ManTech technology, and enables employees to scan in equipment and track the location and scan date of every existing equipment. I used **Python and PyGame** to develop this application.  Source code fully coded by Tarun Ravikumar, now proprietary to ManTech.

### 🤖 ManTech Machine Learning [(View Visualization)](https://tarunravi.tech/ManTechPredictingAppRating/)
Created a **Machine Learning model** that predicts app rating based on ManTech app metadata. 

Then used **D3.js** to create an interactive heatmap on the app metadata. Source code fully coded by Tarun Ravikumar, now proprietary to ManTech.

### ♟️ Chess Tracker [(Website Demo)](https://tarunravi.tech/chessTracker/#/)
 As an avid chess player, I wanted to create a website/app to track the game statistics of each of my opponents. I use React for the front-end of the website, then Firebase for the backend. It uses Google user authentication and private user generated data. [Link to source code]https://github.com/tarunravi/chessTracker

### [⚡ Generate Electricity By Walking](/GenerateElectricityByWalking)

I created a shoe that captures the mechanical energy produced from each step and converts it into useable electricity. [Link to source code](https://github.com/tarunravi/GenerateElectricityByWalking)

### ❎ Tic-Tac-Toe AI [(Website Demo)](https://tarunravi.tech/chessTracker/#/)
[Video Demo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHON6-JC-Xs) I designed an AI to learn how to play the popular game Tic Tac Toe without any humans teaching it using **Q-Learning**. [Link to source code](https://github.com/tarunravi/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI)

### [🃏 BlackJack AI](https://github.com/MyWorldRules/BlackjackAI)
[Video Demo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSLcoP5vAMM) I designed an AI to learn how to play the popular game Tic Tac Toe without any humans teaching it using the **Monte-Carlo Algorithm.** [Link to source code](https://github.com/MyWorldRules/BlackjackAI)

### ⚡ Robot that attends my Online Classes [Video Demo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ9PRr0rcuQ)
 After getting permission from my teachers, for the last week of school I created a bot using **Python and Selenium** (Web Scraping framework) to automatically open my classes based on the date/time. In addition the bot listens to what my teacher says, and can respond if the teacher calls my name.

### ✌ Robot vs Finger on the App 2 Challenge [Video Demo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VJTTI9BsIM)
I created a robot to automate Finger on the App 2, a popular phone game. I used my computer to control my phone, then I used **Python and Pyautogui** to move the cursor to play the game. 

### 😂 Annoying People With Pi [Video Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEBqrb-T1bs)
For Pi Day 2021, I created a robot that texts the digits of Pi to all my friends, one digit at a time. I used **Python and Pyautogui** to control the keyboard, then instead of pre-computing the digits of Pi, I wrote out the power series expansion function to calculate the digits live.
